20-11-2013 - First physical meeting
-----------------------------------

Design interaction considerations

Cluttering
	Gesture to activate interaction
	Should be very rare gesture
	Maybe one could define its own?
	Voice command?
	Paper (not accepted yet):
		Perceptual vs behavioral cluttering

References
	Handsfree-ness is a motivation factor
	Also cognitive load from earlier project
	Modes - related to “cludge” problem, window based vs text based, back in the 30’s
	

Evaluation
	Biking example, period could variate
	Testing concept on paper first
	Physical test
	How many design iterations
	Handsfree audio vs “the old way”
	at least 3 iterations
	Other real world scenarios besides biking example

Implementation
	clear, start to model

Deadline
	Project description
		Invite Thomas as supervisor
		1. draft


Plan (have multiple “threads”)
	References
	Technical challenges
	Design considerations
	Start/setup the project (writing), think about a title

Problem formulation
	Be very clear - it has to be something measurable
	Be very precise


-----------------------------------------
18-12-2013 - physical meeting with Thomas
-----------------------------------------

Questionaire
short as possible
At the end an example/sketch
Complement maybe with interviews (2)
	Better quality

If research is already there - do not make questionaire!

PHD thesis, paper on head gestures, ETRA "head gestures"

How easy is it for people to learn!

Learnability - long study, maybe 2 weeks evaluation

Background description in report
	building up the actual problem(s)
	start up with e.g. bike example problem
	argument

multimodal interaction

RESEARCH!

Next time:
	Send a draft of the thesis
	background + related work are important
	Design (implementation) section, technical stuff


-------------------------------------
09-01-2014 - Research + project setup
-------------------------------------

Report setup, research, version control (github)

Next:
More research - learnability
Background
Xcode project setup - workspace, ihs
Start coding!


--------------------------
22-01-2014 - Skype meeting
--------------------------

Questions for Thomas:
Can a master thesis work as a reference? -> Yes, but low priority
If several contributions to a subject, how many references? -> The more the better!

Outcome:
introduction
	explain problem (high level)
	formalise (more concrete)
	goal, more economic, less cognitive load, concrete
Discussion
	refer back to the goals in problem statement

Focus on related work, scientific part
	Multimodal interaction
	Gesturebased interaction
	Mobile HCI

Related work
	Venn diagram, circles overlap in my project
	After go through every related work ref
	at the end a table, list all work found, columns -> properties for the system e.g.handsfree, put in my system at the final row
