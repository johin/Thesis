Thomas questions
----------------
My contribution:
Evaluate interfaces against a "real world" scenario, application and with accessible hardware
Use evaluated improved interface/interaction ideas from closely related systems
- "real world" scenario, application evaluation
- accessible hardware

Research/related work
- Section name: Research vs Related work?
- Venn diagram
- Table comparison, how many related systems

Design/evaluation plan:
Iterative design process
- First investigate and design an early prototype containing all requirements with minimal effort. Build two/three interaction menus
- Test this prototype on users while observing. Get feedback on menus, improvement suggestions, preferred menu interface
- Finetune and implement suggestions
- Final evaluation on testpersons where traditional music application is compaired
