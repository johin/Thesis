Thomas questions
----------------
My contribution:
Evaluate interfaces against a "real world" scenario, application and with accessible hardware
Use evaluated improved interface/interaction ideas from closely related systems
- "real world" scenario, application evaluation
- accessible hardware

Research/related work
- Section name: Research vs Related work?
- Venn diagram
- Table comparison, how many related systems

Design/evaluation plan:
Iterative design process
- First investigate and design an early prototype containing all requirements with minimal effort. Build two/three interaction menus
- Test this prototype on users while observing. Get feedback on menus, improvement suggestions, preferred menu interface
- Finetune and implement suggestions
- Final evaluation on testpersons where traditional music application is compaired

Research -> Related work
------------------------

Start out with my design, not research areas
Music players, how have they looked before
Mention the problems
Then talk about improvements, look into other madalities, what has been done before
Mobile HCI (good heading)
Shahram term: "Interaction on the move", short paper from 2013
Interaction on the move subsection to the mobile hci
Drop HCI, just mobile HCI

Mobile HCI

Multimodal interaction (wider)
Talk about it in general
Then go into details about head gestures, audio feedback

Venn diagram
Circles (also subsection):
- Mobile music player UI (start with this) (music players right now)
- Mobile HCI (interaction on the move "problem", cognitive load)
- Multimodal interaction (what kind of modalities have people done, spatial sound)


Method
------
How do you intend to address the problem in pr.statement and arrive to the goal
- Describe shortly each iteration


Design
------
Abstract design of the final prototype
Shold solve some of the problems mentioned in related work (head gesture control, etc..)
Menu description here


Implementation
--------------
Early prototype evaluation can be discussed here


Evaluation
----------
Linear format

Combined evaluation:
- Controlled environment (ecological factor low)
- Realistic environment ()

Implementation
--------------
Interaction menus:
- 3D grid, circular menu, 120 degrees, direction attached to head rotation
- 3D grid, circular menu, 360 degrees, "wheel"
