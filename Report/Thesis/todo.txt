Thomas questions

Chapter 2 (Related systems)
- Research systems vs "finished" systems, should i include both?
- Headings for each system?


---------------------
Thomas Feedback
---------------------

Start out with my design, not research areas
Music players, how have they looked before
Mention the problems
Then talk about improvements, look into other modalities, what has been done before
Mobile HCI (good heading)
Shahram term: "Interaction on the move", short paper from 2013
Interaction on the move subsection to the mobile hci
Drop HCI, just mobile HCI

Mobile HCI

Multimodal interaction (wider)
Talk about it in general
Then go into details about head gestures, audio feedback

Venn diagram
Circles (also subsection):
- Mobile music player UI (start with this) (music players right now)
- Mobile HCI (interaction on the move "problem", cognitive load)
- Multimodal interaction (what kind of modalities have people done, spatial sound)

Method:
How do you intend to address the problem in pr.statement and arrive to the goal
- Describe shortly each iteration

Design:
Abstract design of the final prototype
Shold solve some of the problems mentioned in related work (head gesture control, etc..)
Menu description here

Implementation:
Early prototype evaluation can be discussed here

Evaluation:
Linear format

Combined evaluation:
- Controlled environment (ecological factor low)
- Realistic environment ()
