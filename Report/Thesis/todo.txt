- Summary in chapters?

Thomas Feedback
---------------------
Intro:
Distraction -> find another word and explain, e.g. parallel tasks
Already mention "interaction in motion" here
Method ->
	Abstract, what kind of methods, how many iterations

Cognitive load -> needs to be more precise

Mobile Music Player UI + related systems -> maybe another title
- related systems -> be general

System use description should be in design section
In design section:
Look back on related work and reason choosed design
At the end of design section i will have an abstract "solution"

Design:
Present the alternatives

Implementation
Present the alternatives

Evaluation:
Quantitative: Time, Errors
Qualitative: Comfort

Semi-structured interview
Interview, forms
5 people might be a good number
Avoid noise as much as possible

Overall: To ambigous right now - be more precise

Report
---------------------
Design process:
- Rotation positioning mode (fixed vs moving position)
- Gestures recognizing/recording
- Max number of tracks present (3-10)
- Max degree span (max 180, ref claims 120 for shaking head)
- Distance between tracks and user (maybe try out 3 different distances)

Evaluation (closed lab test):
- Track with cones
- Whistle when user should change track
- Result: Measure distance in which user has moved while interacting (Also measure time for 1 round without navigating)
- Result: Form/questionaire (semi-structured interview)

Evaluation (in-situ):
- 3-5 days
- Result: Form/questionaire (Comfort)


---------------------
Application
---------------------
- On init set correct direction
- Add name + date to saved gestures
- Continue playing audio when headset disconnects and connects
- After recording gesture - it should detect it
- Resume playback when cancelling activate
