Thomas Feedback
---------------------
Intro:
Distraction -> find another word and explain, e.g. parallel tasks
Already mention "interaction in motion" here
Method ->
	Abstract, what kind of methods, how many iterations

Cognitive load -> needs to be more precise

Mobile Music Player UI + related systems -> maybe another title
- related systems -> be general

System use description should be in design section
In design section:
Look back on related work and reason choosed design
At the end of design section i will have an abstract "solution"

Design:
Present the alternatives

Implementation
Present the alternatives

Evaluation:
Quantitative: Time, Errors
Qualitative: Comfort

Semi-structured interview
Interview, forms
5 people might be a good number
Avoid noise as much as possible

Overall: To ambigous right now - be more precise
