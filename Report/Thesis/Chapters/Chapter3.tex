\chapter{Design}
In this chapter the design of the system is described. This is done by first describing a design rationale based on the concepts and related work from chapter \ref{sec:relatedwork} and next how the actual system was designed.

\section{Design Rationale}

% From wiki:
% - the reasons behind a design decision,
% - the justification for it,
% - the other alternatives considered,
% - the trade offs evaluated, and
% - the argumentation that led to the decision.

% Intro
Before choosing a design for a system different factors needs to be considered e.g. the reasons behind design decisions and the justification for it; other design alternatives considerations and the tradeoffs when choosing a design over another; the argumentation that lead to the design.

% Ubicomp challenges
When designing for ubicomp new aspects needs to be taken into consideration which increase the complexity of the system e.g. different devices, mobile users and changing environment and context \cite{barfield_fundamentals_2000}. Also we note that we are not only designing user interfaces but also the interactions between a user and the system through artifacts embedded in the environment \cite{beaudouin-lafon_designing_2004}. Furthermore it should be taken into account whether the interaction happens whilst the user is in motion as this introduces even more complexity as decribed earlier in section \ref{sec:interactioninmotion}.

In this project we have defined the following requirements of the system: A user should navigate a music player using head gestures and audio feedback while biking. In other words we have a user interacting with artifacts, consisting of a headmounted interface and a mobile device, while biking in a traffic environment implying user awareness of road conditions, cars, other bikers, etc.

\subsection{Devices}
- Head gestures, sensors on head, headset for audio, mention gaze tracking solution

\subsection{User}
- Physical constrains: Head rotation, Human head normally can be rotated about 140 degrees for shaking and 100 degrees for nodding \cite{lopresti_neck_2000}
- Workload
- Perceptive load
- Mental model

\subsection{Environment}
- Unintentional behaviour e.g. activating menu biking over a bump or a sudden need for rotating head because of obstacles
- Weather conditions, too much wind disrupting the audio, rain on headset
- Noise can disrupt audio


\section{Spatial Music Menu}

\subsection{Soundscape}
- Music, strength of recognizing artist/track through listening vs seeing the text on a screen
- Horizontal argument
- Simultanous sounds, exploring, cocktail party effect argument
- Experimental design, sounds perceived, zoom effect, user should detect sound direction (which track)

Metaphor: Carousel

\subsection{Navigation}
- Adaption of real world music player menu
- Figure showing levels of menu
- Navigation
- Head gestures
- Activating menu
- Feedback when gesture recognized
- Nod = yes

Several studies show that circular auditory menus are the way to go because of horizontally positioned sounds (ref?)

This chapter first explains the design methods used and the most important design activities and choices made in the design process. Based on this process the final prototype design is presented at the end of the chapter.

\section{Design model and methods}
In this section the model used for designing the final prototype is presented including the different techniques used throughout the design process.

The related works conducts the foundations for an early first prototype. This prototype will then go through an iterative design process, taking a user centered approach. This will enable specifications to emerge during the process and these learnings and modifications will result in new experiments and prototypes. This iterative design model is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:iterative}.

\subsection{Envisionment}
One of the goals with the final system is that it should be eyes-free i.e. the user should not depend on a visual screen UI at the end. Despite this goal, the use of a screen to visualize e.g. a virtual menu, can be helpful in the design process. This will enable test users to get a quicker and better understanding of how the interaction works. In this design process a mobile device screen will be used for envisionment - this is also called a hifi prototype or software prototype \cite{benyon_designing_2010}.

More concretely audio sources and the users head position including rotation will be mapped visually to a screen dynamically during user interaction. An example of this screen is shown in figure ?

\section{Design process}
This section starts out by describing the first experimental prototype design inspired from previous research work and then each iteration including user feedback and design changes and experiments. More specifically the design completed 2 iterations before the final prototype design.

\subsection{Initial prototype design considerations}
Before we started to reason about initial design choices we started out by defining what the system actually needed in order to evaluate and revise the hypothesis from the problem statement.

% intro, track exploring
First of all we wanted the system to be able to play music. This is in itself a trivial task but as we the same time wanted to control the system only with with head gestures and audio output a traditional music player includes too many options e.g. play, pause, stop, next/previous, volume, equalizer, track exploring, etc for the scope of this thesis. All the alternative music players mentioned in chapter \ref{sec:relatedwork} is limited to simple commands like play, stop, next/previous and volume. Taking it a step further we wanted to evaluate the track exploring part i.e. navigating to a preferred track and playing it. This made et clear that some kind of auditory menu with tracks as menu items was needed and although not music players the related systems from chapter \ref{sec:relatedwork} using auditory menus could inspire to an intital menu design.

% Auditory menu, exocentric, head rotation constraints
When looking at the different related auditory menu designs we needed to find a design that fitted into the context of the user activity i.e. biking and also user interaction modality. E.g. in a biking scenario the user should have eyes on the road thereby constraining the head rotation. Park et. al \cite{park_gaze-directed_2011} showed good results with a 2D grid menu. It should be taken into account that their audio output consists of simple speech commands e.g. speech recorded numbers. We want to present multiple music streams (non-speech audio) and studies have shown that when presenting multiple non-speech audio streams simultanously in a spatial audio space, segregating the audio streams horizontically has a better effect than vertical alignment [TODO: ref]. It seemed that a circular auditory menu could be a good starting point and both Kajastila and Lokki \cite{kajastila_interaction_2013} and also Brewster et. al \cite{brewster_multimodaleyes-freeinteraction_2003} evaluated this kind of menu design with good results.

[TODO: Image/prototype sketch?]

% Circular menu design, head gestures
While placing music streams in a circular way around a users audio space we needed a way of navigating to and chosing a specific track. The Brewster et. al \cite{brewster_multimodaleyes-freeinteraction_2003} system uses directed nods to choose an item but this limits the number of items to 4 (1 for every 90 degrees) as a nod in 45 degrees

The inititial interaction design was inspired from Kajastila and Lokkis system although they used hand gestures as modality input. 

For navigating and choosing menu items

[TODO: egocentric vs exocentric audio output, Brewster system good ref \cite{vazquez-alvarez_eyes-free_2011}]

% Summarising

[TODO]
In this project multiple audio sources (music tracks) are presented for the user at the same time but none of them requires a respond i.e. the focus is on selective-attention tasks.
