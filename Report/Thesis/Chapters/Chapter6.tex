\chapter{Conclusion}
In this thesis we wanted to examine whether a user interface based on head gestures and 3D audio, could compete with a touch and vision-based user interface in an "interaction in motion" scenario i.e. biking, with respect to general usability and task performance efficiency. In order to examine this 2 goals were defined (page \pageref{})

% explorative design results e.g. number of items 6-8, good

\section{Future Work}

% talk about how more than 3 tracks could be implemented

% solution with a headset controller + spatial audio

%Other scenarios e.g. visual impaired people, car driving...

% Thomas comments
% in general, it should contain:
% 1) reflection over the whole design process (what would you have done different, knowing what you know now (if anything)
% 2) discussion of the main findings of the evaluation (the evaluation chapter has a more detailed discussion). what does it point towards? where is the future of this kind of systems?
% 3) future work (list stuff that was found in eval which could improve future versions of the system, ideas you had yourself but discarded due to lack of resources, etc.)
