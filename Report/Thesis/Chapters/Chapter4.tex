System design overview...

% Milestones - POC
% - Create and setup xcode project including lib references for Intelligent Headset and Spotify
% - Play a users Spotify songs and be able to use panning and volume
% - Place multiple songs in the horizontal range 0-180 degrees of the user using IHS rotation
% - Implement nodding and shaking feedback

% Further improvement
% - Exploring the Spotify lib/playlists
% - Activation of head gestures
% - Fine tuning

% Learnings
% Streaming from Spotify to OpenAL could be difficult. It requires decompressing of the stream; 1) maybe not possible with libspotify, 2) If so very heavy - could affect user experience, 3) OpenAL restrictions
% Idea (avoiding OpenAL's limited audio input properties):
% As we only need horizontal 180 degrees we could use panning. Place x songs from 0-180 degrees. As the user rotates head a song pans in from the direction with increasing volume.
